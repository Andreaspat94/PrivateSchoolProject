# PrivateSchoolProject part A
Its not fully operatable but is my first individual attempt

-------------------------------------------------------------

The application is a prompt(console) application.
It asks the user to add data - students, courses, trainers and assignments and ouput the following:
- A list of all trainers/students/assignments/courses.
- All the students/trainers/assignments per course.
- All the assignments per course
- All students that belong to more than one courses.
- Lastly, the program asks from the user a date and it should output a list of students who need to submit one or more assignments on the same calendar week as the given date.
